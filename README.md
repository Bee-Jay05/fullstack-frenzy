# 🚀 Fullstack Dev Lab – Xyber Sync

Hey, I'm Abiola Abolaji, a fullstack developer in the making — obsessed with building dope websites and crafting futuristic UI with React, Spline, and Three.js.

This repo is my digital playground. It’s where I build, break, learn, and level up.

---

## 🧠 Currently Focused On
- Creating a 3D portfolio experience with **Spline + React + Three.js**
- Building real-world client-style projects (law firm site, AI startup landing, etc.)
- Mastering the full stack with **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, **MongoDB**, and **Node.js**

---

## 🔨 Featured Projects
| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| 🧑‍⚖️ Law Firm Website | A sleek, professional landing page for a fictional law firm | HTML, CSS, JS |
| 🧠 AI Landing Page | Futuristic landing page for an AI product | React, Tailwind |
| 🌐 3D Portfolio | An interactive portfolio with a custom 3D avatar | Spline, React, Three.js |
| 🛠️ Components Hub | Reusable, production-ready UI components | React, Tailwind |

## 🚧 Building This Week
- 3D avatar animations using **Mixamo** + **Spline**
- Adding GSAP scroll animations to projects
- Connecting form backends with **Formspree** and **Node.js**

---

## 🧩 Experiments
- `spline-experiments/` — Weird but cool 3D stuff.
- `components/` — Reusable UI like modals, navbars, hero sections, etc.

---

## 📅 Weekly Dev Ritual
I push **code daily**, even if it’s small.
Every push moves me closer to shipping better, faster, smarter.
